2019 new year resolutions include to try to keep a blog updated... so far, I've:

* tweaked the config to use the [basics](https://github.com/arjunkrishnababu96/basics) theme
* imported the old ghost based blog posts using [ghostToHugo](https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo)

let's see how it goes :)
