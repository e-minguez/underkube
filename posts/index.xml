There are official container images and docker-compose files to be able to run it easily.
For quite a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the nginx+redis+mariadb+cron docker-compose file as it has all the components to be able to run an &amp;rsquo;enterprise ready&amp;rsquo; Nextcloud, even if I&amp;rsquo;m only using it for personal use :)

The main benefit to me of doing so is they they use a single network namespace, meaning all the containers running in the same pod can reach each other using localhost and you only need to expose the web interface.</description></item><item><title>Nextcloud with podman rootless containers and user systemd services.

See the OpenShift official documentation on Managing Security Context Constraints for more details.
Custom SCC 🔗In the event of requiring a custom SCC, there are a few steps that need to be done to be able to use the SCC properly.
Minimal capabilities 🔗The best way to create a custom SCC would be to build it based on the most restricted one (hint: its name is restricted) and then start adding capabilities and permissions depending on the application requisites.</description></item><item><title>Manage external displays with Gnome and Argos extension</title><link>https://www.underkube.com/gnome-displays-argos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 10:18:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.underkube.com/gnome-displays-argos/</guid><description>I wanted to easily switch between my regular desktop configuration: All the external displays: To a single external display: Or just the laptop screen: This usually required to open gnome-control-center, then click displays, etc. So I thought it would be nice to look for a extension in the Gnome Extensions site&amp;hellip; but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any that worked as I wanted&amp;hellip; so let&amp;rsquo;s try to do our own method! :)</description></item><item><title>Podman rootless containers in RHEL7</title><link>https://www.underkube.com/podman-rootless-rhel7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 12:26:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.underkube.com/podman-rootless-rhel7/</guid><description>Quick howto to make podman rootless containers work in RHEL7:

In order to be able to use it, you need to have a real NetApp hardware to play with. It is also true that NetApp offers a simulator to play with.
NOTE: The Simulator is not publicly available and you can only access to it if you are a customer or partner.
